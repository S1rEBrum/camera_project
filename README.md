### Project abstract: 
Large cargo ships transfer containers, cars and additional goods. Therefore, monitoring security state at various locations on a ship is crucial. Current solutions rely on standard CCTV cameras, which require constant power and Ethernet connections.

Captain's Eye, a start-up company, offers a software solution for monitoring cargo ships through a unified system that collects and processes data from all CCTV cameras on a ship, presenting the results via an app for easy tracking by the captain of the ship. Installing CCTV cameras at distant locations on a cargo ship necessitates extensive cabling (for power and for ethernet), making installation complex and costly.

As a result, Captain's Eye proposed a project to develop a solution â€“ small portable camera that does not need constant connection to power and Ethernet and will be able to transfer images for 200 meters and above.

Our project aims to develop such a solution: a low-power, low-cost camera system that operates on battery power source for extended periods and uses wireless connectivity to transfer images. The system will remain in sleep mode until activated by a PIR sensor detecting movement. Once activated, the camera will take a few pictures (2-5) and send them wirelessly to a receiver module near the ship's main server. There, "Captain's Eye" software will analyze the images to determine if an event, such as Trespassing, has occurred, and whether to raise an alarm in the app.

This project involves multiple engineering sub-tasks, including selecting the appropriate wireless connection type, choosing the right hardware, image processing via code and working with CMOS camera sensors. Our goal is to create a viable prototype that successfully passes testing and meets the company's requirements, paving the way for further development into a real-life product.
